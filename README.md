# Enhancing Road Safety in San Francisco Through Data-Driven Strategies

## Presented By Team JUGAADUS - Aggie Hacks'24

### Introduction
This repository contains the work of Team JUGAADUS, presented at Aggie Hacks'24, focusing on using data analytics to enhance road safety in San Francisco. Our goal is to utilize data to identify high-risk locations, collision patterns, and contributing factors for targeted safety improvements.

### Project Overview
- **Background**: San Francisco reports approximately 30 deaths and 4000 injuries per year due to traffic collisions. Vision Zero SF's initiative aims to eliminate all traffic fatalities by 2024.
- **Business Objectives**:
  - Identify high-risk locations and patterns in traffic collisions.
  - Develop strategies to prevent traffic fatalities and injuries.

### Repository Navigation
- `/data` - Contains datasets used in our analysis, including traffic fatalities, signal data, and speed limit information.
- `/models` - Machine learning models developed to predict high-risk zones.
- `/visualizations` - Interactive dashboards created with Tableau to depict our findings.

### Analysis Highlights

- Increased collision incidences on weekdays, with peaks at 8 AM and 4 PM.
- Geographic distribution analysis indicating a correlation between the absence of traffic signals or speed limits and higher collision frequencies.
- Neighborhoods like Mission and South of Market are identified as requiring immediate attention due to high accident rates.
- A majority of collisions are broadside impacts, indicating a need for improved safety measures at intersections.

### Solutions
Our analysis supports the implementation of smart traffic controls and dynamic speed limits, using predictive models to foresee and mitigate traffic risks.

### Implementation Strategy
- Initiate targeted safety measures in high-risk zones.
- Engage with stakeholders for support and resource allocation.
- Conduct public awareness campaigns.

### Challenges and Societal Impact
- Overcoming resource constraints and collaboration challenges.
- Addressing the societal cost of traffic collisions, which significantly affects public revenue and overall economy.

### Conclusion
Our collaborative efforts with city officials, communities, and individuals are crucial to achieving Vision Zero's mission of zero traffic fatalities by 2024.
